Trading-Market

It's a client-server based Trading Market System developed in C and done through socket programming.
Enables clients to login, buy and sell products, view their trades and see the market position (Best buying and selling of Products).

The codes still need some improvements as of I know : 

1. Check whether same client logged in or not.
2. For some unknown reasons selling price of first item isn't coming up quite right.
3. Proper Documentation.

More improvements are always welcomed. :)
